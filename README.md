# Flutter Add To Cart Quantity Widget
A Flutter widget that displays an item count and add to cart button

The widget is a Modal Bottom Sheet and slides up when the user clicks on a product.

In this repository I included only the `lib` folder with the essential widgets.

The code is well commented and easy to understand. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
