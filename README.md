# Flutter Add To Cart Quantity Widget
A Flutter widget that displays an item count and add to cart button

The widget is a Modal Bottom Sheet and slides up when the user clicks on a product.

In this repository I included only the `lib` folder with the essential widgets.

The code is well commented and easy to understand. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this widget came from [Tom Svorobovich's design app](https://dribbble.com/shots/11401747-Cashier-app)
check the image below, it is the top middle input counter and add to cart button
